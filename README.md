# Build and Run test steps #

1. Open your command line
2. Go to the root director project (where the pom.xml file is located)
3. Type mvn clean
4. Type mvn install
5. Go to the target folder
6. Type java -jar transactions-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Test call #



    
   
   
Future improvements
1. Add cache for transaction to handle load 
2. Dockerize so easy to deploy and test
